# "Totally Not Unity Tanks"

# ... STILL IN PROGRESS...

# REMEMBER TO DECOMPRESS: `.../Assets/Winter Zone Mini 1.0/Textures.zip` and `../Assets/StarSparrow/SubstancePainter.zip`

This project is made following "Unity Tanks" official tutorials. You'll recognize some of the codes, but almost all of them are modified in order to make a different game.

"Totally Not Unity Tanks" (name in progress) is a 2 - 4 players shooter game, with space craft.

## Features:

- Two (and more) space crafts added from [`Ebal Studios's Star **Sparrow Modular Spaceship**`](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/star-sparrow-modular-spaceship-73167).
- Using [`Unity Technologies's Post Processing Stack`](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912) for better graphic quality.
- Using [`Meshzone3d's Winter Zone Mini`](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/winter-zone-mini-107583) for battlefield scene.
- Using [`Hard Shell Studios's Input Manager CC`](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/input-manager-cc-57332) for handling inputs.

[IN PROGRESS]
- **Scene 1:** `Battle`
 - - Camera follows all players who are actives in the scene.
